Integrating data science and bioinformatics expertise will be essential for biomarker discovery, predictive modeling, and developing machine learning pipelines to analyze high-dimensional biological data. Joint efforts could also strengthen projects on patient stratification, outcome prediction, and data integration across multiple cohorts, ensuring more robust and reproducible insights.","Focus should be placed on robust data governance frameworks that address data breaches, privacy policies, and ethical considerations in both biological and personal data handling. This includes implementing secure storage systems, encryption protocols, and strict access controls for sensitive datasets. Particular attention should be given to personal data derived from the biometric systems (e.g. personnel profiles, facial recognition, and/or any identifiers), ensuring they are protected against misuse and unauthorised access. Clear guidelines on data ownership, informed consent, and data sharing must be established to safeguard personnel rights while enabling responsible research use.
